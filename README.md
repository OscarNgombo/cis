# Customer Identification Surveyor (CIS)

A Flutter project built to help in facilitating the customer identification survey exercise within Mombasa Water Supply and sanitation company ltd (MOWASSCO).

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a mobile app that supports the features below.

## Features

- Manage customer information
- Validate customer data
- Query customer details from the database
- Updating Customer details

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```s
   git clone https://github.com/OscarNgombo/cis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```s
    cd cis
    ```

4. Ensure to add the database file **island.db** to the **assets** directory. Could you make sure to have account and meter details to query customer details? Also for Firebase configurations and stuff, it's just easier for you to reach out. I'd be more than happy to collaborate and assist.
